Development environment
-----------------------

Set up development environment on Mac and Linux

This project uses `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>`_ for project development. This is not a runtime requirements but it
is the primary development configuration so you will need to have
`uv installed <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>`_ to get the
`dependency locks <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/sync/>`_.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    user@DEVMACHINE123 % uv sync --group dev
    user@DEVMACHINE123 % source .venv/bin/activate
    (venv) user@DEVMACHINE123 % pre-commit install

-------------
Running tests
-------------

To run test, you need to have pytest installed. If you are using the development environment, it should already be
installed. Tests are run by executing the pytest command.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    (venv) user@DEVMACHINE123 tripwire % pytest
    ================== test session starts ===================
    platform darwin -- Python 3.11.10, pytest-8.3.5, pluggy-1.5.0

Build Documentation
-------------------

The documentation for tripwire contains both user and developer documentation. It is written in
`restructuredText format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText>`_ and built with
the `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ tool.

1. Make sure that either the virtual environment is configure with the "dev" or "docs" dependency group

    Either run uv sync with the full development dependencies group:

    .. code-block:: shell-session

        user@DEVMACHINE123 % uv sync --group dev
        Using CPython 3.11.10
        Creating virtual environment at: .venv
        Resolved 82 packages in 12ms
              Built uiucprescon-tripwire @ file:///Users/user/PythonProjects/UIUCLibrary/tripwire
        Prepared 53 packages in 3.97s
        Installed 53 packages in 260ms
         + alabaster==1.0.0
         + argcomplete==3.6.2
         + babel==2.17.0
         + cachetools==6.2.0
         + certifi==2025.8.3
         + cfgv==3.4.0
         + chardet==5.2.0
         + charset-normalizer==3.4.3
        ...


    or run uv sync with only the dependencies needed to build the documentation:

    .. code-block:: shell-session

        user@DEVMACHINE123 % uv sync --no-dev --group docs
        Using CPython 3.11.10
        Creating virtual environment at: .venv
        Resolved 82 packages in 13ms
              Built uiucprescon-tripwire @ file:///Users/user/PythonProjects/UIUCLibrary/tripwire
        Prepared 27 packages in 4.35s
        Installed 27 packages in 348ms
         + alabaster==1.0.0
         + argcomplete==3.6.2
         + babel==2.17.0
         + certifi==2025.8.3
         + charset-normalizer==3.4.3
         + docutils==0.21.2
         + idna==3.10
         + imagesize==1.4.1
         + jinja2==3.1.6
        ...

2. With your virtual environment active, run sphinx-build with the first argument being "docs" and the second argument
   being the location where to build to.
